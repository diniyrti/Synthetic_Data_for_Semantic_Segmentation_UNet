## Synthetic Dataset Deep Learning
Automatic information extraction from massive satellite imagery data, especially using deep learning methods, is very challenging because it requires a large amount of accurate, error-free, and manually annotated training data. Therefore, deep learning model building and evaluation are performed using synthetic datasets to reduce the burden of time-consuming and expensive manual annotation. The creation of this synthetic dataset refers to the research of Clabaut et al. 2024.

This research's synthetic dataset was constructed using the Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach. The process begins with segmenting Sentinel-2 imagery using the Large Scale Mean Shift (LSMS) algorithm in QGIS. LSMS is capable of identifying homogeneous objects in satellite imagery while maintaining the geometric and statistical integrity of each segment (OTB Development Team, 2024), thereby producing homogeneous/pure land use class objects for subsequent processing. Figure 1 displays the Large Scale Mean Shift (LSMS) algorithm settings interface in QGIS software for the satellite image segmentation process. Spatial parameters and range radius are configured to determine the level of detail, with lower values resulting in more detailed polygon segments. This stage serves to convert raster data into vector polygon analysis units.
